Common Lisp CL-SDL2 Adaption for https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

To run the examples:
	1: Place in your local quicklisp project folder (default quicklisp/local-projects)
	2: (quicklisp:quickload :sdl2-tutorials)
	3: (tutorial-1:main) ; etc for each one.
	
Further lessons on-hold as CL-SDL2-TTF has not been updated(which causes issues where you have to choose between crashes or memory leaks). Will probably continue if\once cl-sdl2-ttf has been updated.
